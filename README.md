This is the initial phase in developing a sophisticated chatbot designed to assist individuals by providing medical guidance and recommendations. The primary goal of this chatbot is to simulate a virtual medical assistant, offering users valuable advice on managing and resolving their physical health concerns. By leveraging advanced algorithms and comprehensive medical knowledge, the chatbot aims to deliver accurate, user-friendly responses that can help users address various health issues effectively. This foundational step is crucial in ensuring that the chatbot is equipped with the necessary tools to support users in making informed decisions about their well-being.

This is the second phase of developing the doctor chatbot using the Gemma2 model. Before proceeding with this part, it is essential to complete the first phase, which should be executed in a separate notebook. Once you have successfully run the initial phase, you can then move on to this second phase in a new notebook. For detailed instructions and further information on fine-tuning the Gemma2 model, please refer to the tutorial available at DataCamp. This resource will provide you with comprehensive guidance on optimizing the model to enhance the chatbotâ€™s performance and effectiveness.
